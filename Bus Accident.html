Even worse, if you are a driver,  <a href="#" style="color: #008ca1;"><b>bicyclist, or pedestrian </b></a>who is struck by a bus weighing more than 10,000 pounds, you may suffer life–threatening injuries.

                          In other cases, buses often are operated by or in conjunction with a public entity. Therefore, shorter claim notice periods and statutes of limitations may apply. If you are not quick to put the bus company on notice of your personal injury claim, you can lose all rights to pursue a settlement for your claim.
                            </p>

 <p class="par">Whatever the case may be, you should file a bus accident personal injury claim in a timely manner.

The police report will serve as an important piece of evidence in your personal injury claim.

If the adverse party is at fault in a bus accident, you must file a claim with the bus’ insurance company or with the government (if the government owns or oversees the bus service). There are special time limits for notifying government entities of your damages. If you do not file your claim on time, your case can be dismissed.
